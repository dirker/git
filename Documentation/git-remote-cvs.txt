NAME
----
git-remote-cvs - Helper program for interoperation with CVS repositories

SYNOPSIS
--------
'git remote-cvs' <remote>

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Please see the linkgit:git-remote-helpers[1] documentation for general
information about remote helper programs.

CONFIGURATION
-------------

remote.*.cvsRoot::
	The URL of the CVS repository (as found in a `CVSROOT` variable, or
	in a `CVS/Root` file).
	Example: "`:pserver:user@server/var/cvs/cvsroot`".

remote.*.cvsModule::
	The path of the CVS module (as found in a `CVS/Repository` file)
	within the CVS repository specified in `remote.*.cvsRoot`.
	Example: "`foo/bar`"

remote.*.cachedSymbolsOnly::
	When 'true', a cache of CVS symbols is used instead of querying the
	CVS server for all existing symbols (potentially expensive). In this
	mode, git-remote-cvs will not discover new CVS symbols unless you add
	them explicitly with the "`addsymbol <symbol>`" command (on
	git-remote-cvs's stdin), or request an explicit symbol cache update
	from the CVS server with the "`syncsymbols`" command (on
	git-remote-cvs's stdin). When 'false' (the default), the CVS server
	will be queried whenever a list of CVS symbols is required.

remote.*.usernameMap::
	The path (absolute, or relative to the repository (NOT the worktree))
	to the file that contains the mapping from CVS usernames to the
	corresponding full names and email addresses, as used by Git in the
	Author and Committer fields of commit objects. When this config
	variable is set, CVS usernames will be resolved against this file.
	If no match is found in the file, or if this config variable is unset,
	or if the variable points to a non-existing file, the original CVS
	username will be used as the Author/Committer name, and the
	corresponding email address will be set to "`<username>@example.com`".
+
The format of the usernameMap file is one entry per line, where each line is
of the form "`username: Full Name <email@address>`".
Example: `johndoe: John Doe <johndoe@example.com>`
Blank lines and lines starting with '#' are ignored.

COMMANDS
--------

In addition to the commands that constitute the git-remote-helpers API, the
following extra commands are supported for managing the local symbol cache when
the `remote.*.cachedSymbolsOnly` config variable is true. The following
commands can be given on the standard input of git-remote-cvs:

'addsymbol'::
	Takes one CVS symbol name as argument. The given CVS symbol is
	fetched from the CVS server and stored into the local CVS symbol
	cache. If `remote.*.cachedSymbolsOnly` is enabled, this can be used
	to introduce a new CVS symbol to the CVS helper application.

'syncsymbols'::
	All CVS symbols that are available from the given remote are
	fetched from the CVS server and stored into the local CVS symbol
	cache. This is equivalent to disabling `remote.{asterisk}.cachedSymbolsOnly`,
	running the "list" command, and then finally re-enabling the
	`remote.*.cachedSymbolsOnly` config variable. I.e. this command can
	be used to manually synchronize the CVS symbols available to the
	CVS helper application.

'verify'::
	Takes one CVS symbol name as argument. Verifies that the CVS symbol
	has been successfully imported be checking out the CVS symbol from
	the CVS server, and comparing the CVS working tree against the Git
	tree object identified by `refs/cvs/<remote>/<symbol>`. This can be
	used to verify the correctness of a preceding 'import' command.
